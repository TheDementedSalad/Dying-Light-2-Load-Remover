# Dying Light 2 Autosplitter
This is done for free, but if you'd like to support me you can here. https://ko-fi.com/thedementedsalad

# Instructions
Depending on which game you want to play, edit your splits and change the game name to "Dying Light 2" A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate".

After activating the autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to TheDementedSalad, he's in the Amok Runner Speedrunning Tourny Discord

Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.
If a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact TheDementedSalad.
